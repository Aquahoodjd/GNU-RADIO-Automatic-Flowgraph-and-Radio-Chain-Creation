# GNU-RADIO-Automatic-Flowgraph-and-Radio-Chain-Creation
This will update the flowgraph and create a new radio chain based on signals that are passed into it

Please note that the detect_peak_frequencies function is a placeholder and needs to be implemented properly. It should analyze the input data and return a list of frequencies and the corresponding PSD values.

The function create_radio_chain constructs a radio receiver chain (lowpass filter -> squelch -> NBFM receiver -> audio sink) for a specific frequency. It returns a gr.top_block instance that represents this radio receiver chain.

In the work function, we call detect_peak_frequencies to find the peak frequencies in the input data. If the PSD of a detected frequency is above a certain threshold (self.psd_threshold), we create a radio receiver chain for this frequency, start it, and add it to the self.radio_chains list.

Keep in mind that this code does not limit the number of active radio chains. If too many radio chains are created and started, the system could get overwhelmed. To prevent this, you could add some logic to limit the number of active radio chains. For example, you could stop the oldest radio chain before starting a new one if the number of active radio chains is above a certain maximum limit.
